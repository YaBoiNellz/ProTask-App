//Pro Task Calendar App Documentation

## Calendar.css
1. First I started off the css code by adding an import react from react and a import from Calendar.css the main reason I added this in the code was to start off by linking the Calendar documentation so that when I eventually debug and test the code that it would link to what was written in the calendar css and js code so that when we use the react commands such npm start that it leads straight to the calendar portion in the app

2. Next, I started off with creating and declaring a function app with a <div class> function the nain intention of this was to establish the title of the calendar and the contents that would be displayed as the calendar drops down in the app menu. the idea I initially had was that as soon as the calendar displayed it would show arrows followed by the dates

3. After I added this function into the calendar css code what I decided to do next was bring everything together. In addition, I added a Calendar class that had a constructor component. After that I decided to add functions and code that strictly define the dates and month with their corresponding days. I added a function that was formatted as this.months after that I started to add each month such as January, February, March, April, etc with the correct days each month had. For instance, January has 31 eays listed in the month. I followed this same format for each month making sure every date/month would have the correct numbers of days so that the app can display each month with the following dates.

4.After each date was listed i added a render function, this function contains more components to add on to the calendar. after the dates are listed. the calendar will need components to help support everything together. it has functions of the class name, month, and date.

## Calendar.js
1. Similarly to the Calendar.css file I started off by writing a import react from react function. After that was implemented I decided to implement a public class which extended and contained a React.Component.

2. Next, I then implemented a constructor class after that was done i then Defined the month and corresponding days. Similarly, to the Calendar.css each month and the maximum amount od days were added to the month. I specifically made sure to take into to account for February to not include the leap year days in the month of February. 

3. After each date was listed i added a render function, this function contains more components to add on to the calendar. after the dates are listed. the calendar will need components to help support everything together. it has functions of the class name, month, and date.

4. Now, that the Calendar.js file is completed i figured both parts are completed now and by running the npm start commands for reach I expect a page to open up in my browser that will direct me and any user to the calendar.

## Challenges of App Assignment and Getting the Calendar to Work

There were some roadblocks I ran into when constructing the calendar, some of the challenges were challenging in a good way. Facing thse challenges made me thought od different strategies/methods. When i first started constructing my code for the Calendar I swapped and made many edits. I ended uo scarooing my old pervious code 5 different times. the main challenge I faced was getting my calendar implemented into our Pro Task I had the code written beforehand the main issue was combining it into everything and making it run on my system. Whenever I would try to run the npm start command on my mac I would face issues as the code would not be recognized on neither my vs code or terminal applications. Noticing this I then went to different platforms such as Figma making a mock prototype of what I would like my calendar to represent and display. I added different components and borders to allign the calendar the way I envisioned for the app. if anything this capstone assignment has taught me alot in working with a team. it has taught me to lean on my team for the moments I feel like I will stumble. working with one another was great in ther fact that we were able to put our minds together in trying to help each other with challenges that came our way. In addition, it has shown me to always think of a backup in case something does not go fully in the way you expect it to.
